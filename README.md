# .vim
My current vim settings. There are many ways to configure Vim, but this is mine. 

I don't use Vim as a full-fledged IDE, and I want it to work the same everywhere, so I avoid using plugins. I generally work on small projects so this hasn't been an issue for me yet. I also like to remap my Caps Lock key to Escape, but that is a system setting and cannot be stored in this repo.

I prefer 4 spaces everywhere and no tabs anywhere for indenting. I like absolute line numbers and hate relative line numbers. I like dark colors in the terminal and light colors in the GUI. I try to keep line length to below 100 characters and force line wrap at 120. 

## Installation

To install on all of my systems, I clone the project to my home directory and Vim just does it's thing. On my Mac I also install the Solarized color scheme to iTerm2. See the Solarized website for more information.
